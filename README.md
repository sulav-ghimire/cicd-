**DevOps and Software Delivery**

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

Benefits of DevOps in Software Delivery

- Faster Deployment: Automated pipelines allow teams to deploy software rapidly and more frequently.
- Improved Collaboration: Developers, testers, and operations work together, reducing handoffs and misunderstandings.
- Higher Reliability: Continuous integration and testing help catch bugs early, improving system stability.
- Increased Efficiency: Infrastructure as code and automation reduce manual work and errors.
- Faster Feedback: Monitoring and feedback loops enable teams to detect and respond to issues quickly.

DevOps helps organizations achieve higher deployment frequency, faster time to market, and improved product quality.
